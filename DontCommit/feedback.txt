Your Boss says:

"It's important to always use an API key when you can. Get your own API 
key and put it into the strings.xml file."

Stefan says:

“This app took me a while to figure out, but it is totally worth it! It 
helps me keep track of when to be glued to my TV, and keeps me up to date 
when I’m not.”

Moizeé says:

“I have trouble navigating and understanding this app. It is not 
accessible to those of us without perfect vision."

Jennie says:

“I like the functionality of this app, but I hate having to open it up 
every time I want to check for a new game. Can’t you put something on the 
home screen for us?”
